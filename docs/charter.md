# Muxide Charter (v0.1.0)

This charter freezes the goals, non‑goals and constraints for the **Muxide** project prior to the first implementation slices.  It is an immutable reference for the duration of the v0.1.0 development cycle and should not be modified once agreed upon.

## Goal

Deliver a **recording‑oriented MP4 writer** in pure Rust that:

1. Provides a **simple API**: *just give me encoded frames and timestamps; I will write an MP4 file*.
2. Supports **H.264 video** and optional **AAC audio**.
3. Enforces **monotonic timestamps**, rejects unsupported features (e.g. B‑frames), and fails fast on invalid inputs.
4. Produces files that play correctly in major players (QuickTime, VLC, Windows Movies & TV, Chromium) without requiring external tools.
5. Adheres to the **Slice‑Gated Engineering Doctrine**: work is delivered in small, verifiable slices with objective gates, and no refactoring or extra features are introduced until v0.1.0 is complete.

## Definition of Done

A v0.1.0 release is considered complete when all of the following are true:

1. A public API crate (`muxide`) is published to crates.io with a minimum major version of 0.1.0.
2. The crate can write a short MP4 file (with H.264 video and, optionally, AAC audio) that plays back in the player matrix without errors.
3. All slices in the v0.1.0 slice ladder have passed their gates and no TODOs remain for the v0.1.0 scope.
4. The API is documented with examples and invariants; any missing features are explicitly marked as such.

## Non‑Goals

The following are explicitly out of scope for v0.1.0 and must not be implemented until a future milestone:

* **Alternative containers** (MKV, WebM, MOV).
* **Streaming formats** (fragmented MP4, CMAF, DASH, HLS).
* **Additional codecs** (H.265/HEVC, VP9, AV1, Opus, FLAC, PCM).
* **B‑frame support** or any re‑ordering of video frames.
* **Random access editing** (insertion/deletion of frames after writing).
* **Asynchronous IO or non‑blocking writers**.
* **Performance optimisations** (e.g. SIMD, multithreading).

## Constraints

* **Pure Rust:** The implementation must not rely on C libraries or FFmpeg bindings.  External crates from crates.io may be used only if they are pure Rust and do not pull in a C runtime.
* **Bundle size:** No more than 500 KB of compiled code (excluding dependencies) should be added for the v0.1.0 release.  This encourages a minimal dependency footprint.
* **Static API:** The public API defined in `docs/contract.md` must remain unchanged throughout the v0.1.0 cycle unless a breaking change is justified and approved.
* **No unsafe code in the public API:** Unsafe may be used internally if necessary, but public functions and types must remain safe.
* **Gate enforcement:** Each slice must have a clearly defined acceptance gate (typically a test or example) that can be run with a single command and results in a pass/fail outcome.

## Truth Anchors

During development, the following will serve as sources of truth and correctness:

1. **Golden files**: Sample MP4 files generated by known‑good tools (e.g. FFmpeg) will be checked into the repository.  New files produced by Muxide must byte‑compare equal to these fixtures for the same input bitstreams.
2. **Player matrix**: Files produced by Muxide must play without errors in QuickTime (macOS), VLC (multi‑platform), Windows Movies & TV (Windows 11), and Chromium (cross‑platform).  Automated tests will run the `mp4dump` tool or player probes to ensure structural correctness where possible.
3. **API invariants**: The contract document defines invariants (e.g. monotonic PTS, one video track per file) that must hold; violations must result in a clear error, not silent correction.

## Roles & Responsibilities

* **Planner (you)**: Prepares the slice ladder and monitors gate results.
* **Implementer (AI)**: Executes slices, writes code and tests, and reports gate outcomes.  The implementer must respect the slice definitions and not expand scope.

## Versions

* **v0.1.0**: Core MP4 muxing with H.264 video and optional AAC audio; single video and audio track; no B‑frames; blocking IO.
* **v0.2.0+**: Fragmented MP4, multiple containers, additional codecs, streaming support, performance improvements.

Once this charter is committed, it should remain unchanged for the duration of the v0.1.0 cycle.  Future releases may introduce a new charter.

## Highlights

Muxide v0.2.0 expands fragmented MP4 (fMP4) support across multiple video codecs and tightens “input contract” enforcement to avoid producing ambiguous or fragile output.

- Fragmented MP4 (fMP4) init+media segment support for H.264, H.265/HEVC, AV1, and VP9
- HEVC `hvcC` signaling tightened (array structure matches emitted parameter sets; 4-byte NAL length prefixes)
- Fragmented sample contract clarified: MP4 length-prefixed samples (4-byte NAL length prefixes), not Annex B start codes
- Fragmented muxer enforces monotonic DTS (rejects decreasing DTS instead of underflowing)
- Timestamp validation rejects non-finite (NaN/Inf) PTS/DTS (video) and PTS (audio)
- MP4 size hardening prevents `mdat` size/offset overflow with deterministic boundary errors

## Interop / Conformance Scope

H.264 outputs were spot-checked with FFmpeg/ffprobe (non-fragmented MP4 and concatenated fMP4 init+segment); broader player/device conformance validation is ongoing.
